# Trash, Mediocre, Above average, Fabled, Mythical, Ancient, Whimsical, Omnipotent

#Import necessary libraries
import random  #For random selection based on weighted probabilities
import time    #To control the timing of the spinning and pauses
import os      #Optional, for clearing the screen 

#Step 1: Define the categories and their corresponding probabilities
categories = [
    ("Trash", 50.0),       #Trash has a 50% chance of being chosen
    ("Mediocre", 28.0),    #Mediocre has a 28% chance of being chosen
    ("Above Average", 12.0), #Above Average" has a 12% chance
    ("Fabled", 6.5),       # Fabled" has a 6.5% chance
    ("Mythical", 2.6),     #Mythical" has a 2.6% chance
    ("Ancient", 0.9),      #Ancient" has a 0.9% chance
    ("Whimsical", 0.8),    #Whimsical" has a 0.8% chance
    ("Omnipotent", 0.1)    #Omnipotent" has a 0.1% chance
]

#Step 2: Separate category names and probabilities
category_names, probabilities = zip(*categories)


#Step 3: Define the function to simulate the "spin" and select a category
def spin_wheel():
    #Step 4: Prompt the user to press enter to spin
    print("Click enter to Spin...")
    input()  #Wait for the user to press Enter

    #Step 5: Simulate the spinning effect by flashing through categories
    print("\nSpinning...", end="")  #Initial message for spinning
    for _ in range(3):  #Loop to simulate the spinning, flashing the categories
        for category in category_names:  #Loop through each category
            print(f"\r{category}", end="", flush=True)  # verwrite the previous category
            time.sleep(0.1)  #Pause briefly to create the flashing effect

    #After flashing, display a message saying it's "selecting"
    print("\r...Selecting...", end="", flush=True)
    time.sleep(0.5)  # Wait briefly before the final choice

    # Step 6: Randomly select a category based on the defined probabilities
    chosen_category = random.choices(category_names, probabilities)[0]  # Select one category based on weights
    
    #Step 7: Show the result
    print(f"\nCongrats! You got: {chosen_category}")

#Step 8: Call the function to start the spin
spin_wheel()
